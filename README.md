# Market Engine Client

## Overview

A powerful GPU-Powered Tradeup engine designed to brute-force millions of profitable CS2 tradeups as quickly as possible. The engine can run on either your CPU, or as many GPU'S as you have installed (cross-vendor). Provides many parameters you can tweak to increase efficiency, and you can easily view your tradeups via an easy to use manager. Also includes an item viewer in order to see all CS2 market items and their details. All tradeups are hashed, meaning that duplicates will not be saved, which in turn means saving a lot of time.
